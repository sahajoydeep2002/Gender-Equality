## Inspiration
The inspiration was to challenge the patriarchal society and imagine a world where all genders are treated equally. That is why we chose to collect data under the politics track and study the lack of gender equality across the world

## What it does
In our study, we have shown the lack of gender equality in three domains - -Education -Entrepreneurship -Politics

We visualized our data to come to the conclusion that comparing today to the past, there has been significant improvement and women occupy more spaces than before, but the progress is excruciatingly slow. And if we want to progress towards a more equal society, we need to put our best foot forward RIGHT NOW.

## How we built it
We designed it using HTML, CSS and Javascript and implemented the code in Visual Studio Code.

## Challenges we ran into
We are beginners at data visualization, so we managed to learn new things and implement them successfully.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully collected and visualized our data and completed our study to the conclusion that there has been significant improvement and women occupy more spaces than before, but the progress is excruciatingly slow.

## What we learned
If we worked together as a team, acknowledge everyone's opinions and ideas, use each member's skills to our advantage, we can accomplish anything.

## What's next for Study Of Gender Equality Around The World
Data Visualization gives a clear idea about the information and makes it easier to identify trends and patterns. Our team will focus on creating more projects related to data study by taking up different social issues and having realized how far away from gender parity is we need to actively work towards making this world a safe, inclusive and equal world for all genders, mostly women and non-binary folks.
